You can merge or split cells from multiple selected cells.

**Flexible Styling**

You can set various styles for each tag of table, cell, and caption individually.

**Advanced UI**

You can easily select a batch of cells in a section, or select, add, or delete rows and columns with the buttons.

The breakpoints for switching between Desktop and mobile can be changed freely.
